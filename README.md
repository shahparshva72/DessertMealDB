# Fetch - iOS Coding Exercise using Meal API

## Solution Approach

- Perform networking using the two API endpoints mentioned
  
- Utilized MVVM architecture in SwiftUI
  
- Handled all the possible null or empty values that were found exploring the Meal API
  
- Performed necessary unit tests as needed.
  
- For the fetching the meal details by it's id and decoding it, I looped through the ingredients and measures dynamically to get the associated values, which made it easy to display the values in UI.
  
- Added additional details in detail view like youtube link and recipe source link and load safari inside the app for those links.
  

## Libraries used:

- While the UI for the project was built using SwiftUI, no other external libraries or tools were used to develop this project.
  
- Swift Language: 5.8
  
- Xcode Version: Xcode 14.3 (latest)
  

## How to run:
